* A trained model is used to classify an image of users choice.
* The Notebook is well documented with comments and details about key terminologies.
* References are included for better/deeper understanding of the same.
* Next phase will be to define my own Neural Network.

##Update 2
* New example has been added to *Deep Neural Network with Caffe (1).ipynb* file.
* *Deep Neural Network with Caffe (1).ipynb* will cover both example 1 and 2. 
* A markdown version of the notebook is available in the *MD Files* folder.


##Working on:
* Install caffe in a spark cluster utilizing CaffeonSpark by yahoo!
* Get systems up, configured and ready for testing.
