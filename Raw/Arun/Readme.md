* Tutorial focuses on Classification of images and is based on Caffe's own example.
* A trained model is used to classify an image of users choice.
* The Notebook is well documented with comments and details about key terminologies.
* References are included for better/deeper understanding of the same.
* Next phase will be to define my own Neural Network.

##Update 2
* New example has been added to *Deep Neural Network with Caffe (1).ipynb* file.
* *Deep Neural Network with Caffe (1).ipynb* will cover both example 1 and 2. 
* A markdown version of the notebook is available in the *MD Files* folder.

##Update 3
* Added an image file which summarizes the basic architecture of Caffe.

##Update 4:
* Installed caffe in a spark cluster utilizing CaffeOnSpark by yahoo!
* Set up 2 capable servers with packages required for caffe and tensorflow.

##Working on:
* Getting ready for testing CaffeOnSpark.
* Working on integrating Nvidia K40 GPU with the prepared servers and rebuilding Caffe, Tensorflow.
